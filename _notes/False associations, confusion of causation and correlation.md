title: False associations, confusion of causation and correlation
---

Our thinking is associative, and we can make connections very fast based on very small data. A typical example is superstition, which is clearly seen in [pigeon experiments](https://www.psychologistworld.com/superstition).

Survival bias and filtering are accompanying flaws that lead to false associations. In probability theory, this is related to the fact that independent events are not necessary conditionally independent.

Even when our associations are quite objective we can make false conclusions about the causes. In fact, in probability theory and statistics the notion of a _cause_ is not even defined. Events can be either correlated or independent in this theory. To deduce _what causes what_ we use other tools, like common sense, physics, etc. Typically, to deduce a causation from two correlated events, we check two main things:

1.  One event is earlier in time than another one.
2.  There is no common cause that could explain the correlation.

This is hard stuff even for scientists. Because you have to exclude any possible common cause. Earlier we could use physical locality of events to exclude a lot of possible common causes. But with the advance of quantum mechanics, even locality is not a reliable factor anymore.
