title: The secret to Learning any skill faster
---

- **Learning with intent** - Always keep in mind about the intent of learning - be it before any practice session or anytime we sit to learn about that particular skill.
- **Make yourself well versed in the fundamentals** - you canâ€™t be proficient in something whose fundamentals you are not aware of - once you know the fundamentals you now posses a flexible means of playing around with what you are going to learn.
- **Watch and Observe others** - Many experts in their field spend time not just by studying or practicing their skill, but by also observing the works of others - will help us in knowing about their thinking process in how they do their job.
- **Practice the works of others** - By practicing we make ourselves exposed to the works of others - thereby making us knowledgeable about their vocabulary - the main goal is not to copy their work, but to expose ourselves to the nuance of their work, so that we can take what we want from them and use it in our own style.


During the pursuit of mastering any skill, mind plays a crucial role.
One must understand the hindrance posed by the mind in order to conquer it.
