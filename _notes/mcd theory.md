> as humans we are natural editors than we are as writers.

A rough draft gives control to the recipients to become collaborators. The art of editing and refining does something to people â€” they make the idea their own.

Not everyone puts themselves out there in a group setting with a rough idea. It's feels like a risky proposition, but only by doing so repeatedly can we aim to become [[original thinkers]]. Not everyone can come up with original ideas initially, but taking initiative even when the ideas are half-baked, sometimes quarted baked is what that makes us stand out.

We can use this very human construct to break ice and start conversations.

You are with a group of friends, colleagues and no one has any ideas for lunch, suggest McDonal's.

Creative sparks fly. Nothing rallies the group better than this initial suggestion.
