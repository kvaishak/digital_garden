Change is a scary thing. No matter in what ways it might manifest in our lives, it’s always scary when we have to go through a change. There is this quote by a really mysterious man -

> "No matter how you get there, or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home." - Creed Bratton, The Office
  
What it indirectly implies is that we as humans are incredible at adapting to any scenario. But this adapting takes time and effort.

The more we get comfortable with a particular routine it becomes increasingly hard to come out of it. The inherent feeling of losing control of the routine element in one's life makes one feel weak. Coupled with the disappointment that the effort and time it took for one to ease into their routine life are all going down in drains is enough to make anyone detest change in their lives.

Just like how Mark Manson in his book 'The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck' tells in his book -

> There’s a certain comfort that comes with knowing how you fit in the world. Anything that shakes up that comfort—even if it could potentially make your life better—is inherently scary.

Change even the ones that could improve the quality of life might be scary at first. There is no real remedy for this. Life really is a big series of ups and downs. There will be big scary changes that you know are better for your life. You just have to face it and be brave enough to leave your comfort zone.

In the end, make sure you have really good memories to remember rather than a plain monotonous life.
