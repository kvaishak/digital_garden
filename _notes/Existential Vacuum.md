title: Existential Vacuum
---

from [[Man's Search for meaning]].

In 21st century no instincts/tradition tells human being what he/she must do - sometimes he himself does not even know what he wishes to do.

Instead 

* he wishes to do what other people are doing - **conformism**
* he does what other people wish him to do - **totalitarianism**

This results in the individual losing interest in what he/she is doing and again reverting to the bored state, thereby continuing the cycle. This bored state often result in us feeling empty inside.

> Existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom
