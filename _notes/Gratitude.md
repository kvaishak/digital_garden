title: Gratitude
---

More often we are displeased with how our life is right now, we try to find the [[the purpose]] in life. Though its a difficult process to search for, understand and even conceptualise a meaning for life, often times being grateful for what we have at present makes us realise the beauty of life as it is.

It can surprisingly work for a variety of areas and situations, for example -
Imagine having a mediocre sandwich or even a handful of nuts out of a bag, and it kind of sucks. Imaging that you have just traveled around all day collecting the nuts or the ingredients needed for the sandwich and then you are eating them one by one and savour the nourishment.
When you drink a glass of water, imaging that you are stranded in the desert for a long time and you have just stumbled upon an oasis with fresh water.

It works just as well on non-food related stuffs too.
If you are tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep, vividly remember the experience of trying to sleep in a middle seat on an airplane - and how badly you would be fantasising about being in a bed.
Or imagine its the morning and your alarm just went off.

Imagine the experience of having a sore throat when you donâ€™t have one and enjoy the glorious lack of pain. When you are in a hot shower, imagine those times when a showers water devastatingly maxes out at lukewarm. In a lukewarm shower, imagine how thrilled a 1750 person would be.
