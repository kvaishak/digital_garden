title: Pupils and Effort
---

from [[Thinking, fast and slow]]

Daniel Kahneman in during his researching days had collaborated with a graduate student and found out the relation of pupils with mental effort.

> Pupils are often described as window to your soul

or was it the eyes ðŸ¤” ?

Anyways he had found out that when a subject (human person) is thinking about any task for example doing moderately complex mathematical calculation, his pupils tend to dilate(expand).

More complex the task is, the more the pupils tend to get dilated. And once the task has been completed and the subject unloads this task from his/her short-term memory the pupils return back to their normal stage.

He was able to figure out when the subject had stopped finished or gave up on the task by just looking for relaxation of their pupils. 

Hence the quote that they truly are the windows to our soul.
