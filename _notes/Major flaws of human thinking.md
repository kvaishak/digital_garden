title: Major flaws of human thinking
---

As in the lovely child’s quote found on the internet —

> I know everything. Except anything I don’t.

— we think that we see everything around us. But we don’t. There are so many things that greatly affect our lives, yet we don’t aware of them. One type of such things is deep inside us — the flaws of our own thinking. Here is my top list of those flaws.

1. [[Wishful thinking, conservatism and conformism]]
2. [[Binary (black-and-white) thinking, overgeneralization]]
3. [[Self-projecting thinking]]
4. [[Human-centric thinking]]
5. [[False associations, confusion of causation and correlation]]
